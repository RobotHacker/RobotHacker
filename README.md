### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Projects that I'd like to work on:
  -  Mini robot about 1 inch tall to explore under things and retrieve items
  -  Sensor helmet with ESP-32 Cams, AMG8833 (or other) thermal cameras, and maybe a Raspberry Pi server
  -  Jumping or launching robot to explore (like Boston Dynamic's Sand Flea)
  -  Quadcopter and/or robot with multiple cameras controlled by multiple people
      -  One pilot, multiple operator stations (cameras, manipulators,  etc.)
  -  Skeletonics like unpowered upper torso mecha(?) system
  -  Robot that can run around with the cats outside
  -  Mechanical remote manipulator to allow safer operation of a lichtenburg wood burning sytem by the public
      -  Like a hot cell manipulator arm
